// Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map with a log of the
// events that happened during the game. The values are the events themselves, and the
// keys are the minutes in which each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes
// plus some extra time).
// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no duplicates)
// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 was
// unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
// 3. Print the following string to the console: "An event happened, on average, every 9
// minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
// 4. Loop over the events and log them to the console, marking whether it's in the first
// half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
//  [FIRST HALF] 17: 丘쬂잺 GOAL
console.log(`
