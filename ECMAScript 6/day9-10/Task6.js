// TASK #6
// Julia and Kate are studying dogs, and they are studying if dogs are
// eating too much or too little.
// Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than
// the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
// Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is
// within a range 10% above and 10% below the recommended portion
// (see hint).
// 1. Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog,
// calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as
// a new property. Do NOT create a new array, simply loop over the
// array. Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The
// result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too
// much or too little. HINT: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you
// first need to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit
// tricky (on purpose) ðŸ¤“
// 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
// ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat
// too little ('ownersEatTooLittle').
// 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this:
// "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John
// and Michael's dogs eat too little!"
// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating EXACTLY the
// amount of food that is recommended (just true or false)
// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an OKAY amount of
// food (just true or false)
// 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an OKAY amount of
// food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
// 8. Create a shallow copy of the dogs array and sort it by recommended
// food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are
// inside the array's objects)
// HINT 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended
// portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current <
// (recommended * 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between
// 90% and 110% of the recommended portion.
